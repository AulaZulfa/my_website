        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Nur Aula Zulfa bt. Zamri. I love everything about food.</p>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website, where I share my journey a bit about my life!</p>
        <p>Here, you’ll find everything about me—from my education and experience to my favorite hobbies and something that I love in my life.</p>
        <p>I'm currently in my last semester as a student, and I'm so excited to share my journey with you. Aside from my studies, I have a deep love for books—especially novels. Reading is my escape, and it’s how I unwind after a long day.</p>
        <p>When I’m not reading or studying, you’ll usually find me watching Kdramas. I’m a huge fan of Korean idols, especially <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saythename_17/?hl=en" target="_blank">Seventeen</a>, and their 
            music always brings a smile to my face. I also enjoy cooking when I'm alone. It’s a time I get to be creative and experiment with flavors. Food is a huge part of my life; I can never get enough of it! Whether I’m whipping up a new recipe or indulging in a new dish, food always brings me joy.</p>
        <p>This website is a space where I share my journey, from my education and experiences to the things that inspire me along the way.</p>
