            <p>Hi, my name is Nur Aula Zulfa bt. Zamri. I love everything about food</p>
            <p>Let’s click <a href="#skills">Skills</a> to see what skills I have!</p>

            <font face = "Arial"><p>Welcome to my personal website, where I share my journey a bit about my life!!</p>
            <p>Here, you’ll find everything about me—from my education and experience to my favorite hobbies and something that I love in my life.</p>
            <p>I'm currently in my last semester as a student, and I'm so excited to share my journey with you. Aside from my studies, I have a deep love for books—especially novels.
                Reading is my escape, and it’s how I unwind after a long day.</p>
            <p>When I’m not reading or studying, you’ll usually find me watching Kdramas. I’m a huge fan of Korean
                idols, especially <font color="#009688">Seventeen</font>, and their music always brings a smile to my face. I also enjoy cooking
                when I'm alone. It’s a time I get to be creative and experiment with flavors. Food is a huge part of my
                life; I can never get enough of it! Whether I’m whipping up a new recipe or indulging in a new dish,
                food always brings me joy.
            </p>
            <p>This website is a space where I share my journey, from my education and experiences to the things
                that inspire me along the way.
            </p></font>
